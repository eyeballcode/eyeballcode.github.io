        <h3>My Interests</h3>
        <h2>Making Public Transport websites</h2>
      </header>
      <p>Based in Melbourne, I have made two Next Departures apps - one for Melbourne and one for Singapore. I sometimes also make random projects to automate and simplify things in my life.</p>
      <p>I also make some digital art in my free time and will never give up a chance for some photography.</p>
      <p>Technology and automation has always been part of my toolkit that lets me stay ahead of the others in the quest for chasing trains.</p>

        <h3>My Projects</h3>
        <h2>A collection of random things</h2>
      </header>
      <ul class="listing">
        <li class="haze-scraper">
          <h4>Haze Scraper</h4>
          <p>My first practical app written in Java, this was made in 2015 during Year 7, a time of extreme haze in Singapore to the point where home-based learning was implemented.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="transportsg">
          <h4>TransportSG</h4>
          <p>First made in 2017, this was my first big project in Year 9 made to display Next Bus data as I was unsatisfied with the existing bus apps available.</p>
          <p>I have since continuously updated and rewritten the site as I got better at programming over the years.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="transportvic">
          <h4>TransportVic</h4>
          <p>A follow up to TransportSG after moving to Melbourne in 2019, I started work on a new website to track all forms of PTV across Melbourne, and eventually Victoria.</p>
          <p>The site was made in my free time while studying for my VCE during Years 10 - 12, and was made with input from schoolmates on both the code and the design.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="onboard">
          <h4>OnBoard</h4>
          <p>Made during the COVID-19 lockdown after a Metro driver was interested in TransportVic, this driver-oriented site was first written in PHP and subsequently rewritten in NodeJS, running TransportVic in the backend.</p>
          <p>It is by far the website with my largest user base, with around 800 users registered on it.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="ordloh">
          <h4>ORDLOH</h4>
          <p>What is the fun of using an existing ORD app when you can make your own? ORDLOH was made as a custom solution to counting my days to POP, SCGP and my ORD. It helps track my leave and paydates at a quick glance.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="eds-sim">
          <h4>EDS Simulator</h4>
          <p>Ever wanted to own an electronic destination display from a bus but found it too bulky to fit in your pocket? Fear not, this simulator shrinks it down into a small Webapp that can be brought anywhere!</p>
          <p>This project eventually spurred the development of a real world Next Train Display driver that is able to link up with OnBoard for remote control.</p>

          <p>I undertook my VCE Studies at JMSS, always pushing myself by taking extension subjects such as Algorithmics and University Extension Mathematics (University of Melbourne), eventually scoring an ATAR of 99.65.</p>
          <p>I throughly enjoyed my time here working with other like-minded people sharing interests in Mathematics as well as Technology.</p>
